The benchmarking code generates a JSON file and a log with the results of each operation. This functionality was included after executing the dense matrix benchmark, and due to the considerable amount of time required for the dense matrix algorithms to complete their tasks, the corresponding JSON file for these benchmarks is not included in the project. However, screenshots of the console log have been provided to display the relevant results.
